1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? 

It creates a .git within the file folder I am working. It will allow me to track any files within that folder. I need it so that I am able to push, pull and make commits allowing me to use version control on my set of files. 

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? 

The staging area allows for files to be added and removed without leaving a permanent mark on the repository. This is important because it keeps the repository clean and only reflects the changes you want to remember.
